### Solution Architect [@OsmosysSoftware](https://github.com/OsmosysSoftware)

Working as a Solution Architect at [Osmosys Software Solution](https://osmosys.co/). I love to explore new tech. I spend my time on analysing the project requirements, design engineering solutions, writing code, deploying and managing the products.

I play [Dota 2](https://www.dota2.com/home) on steam with my colleagues. I love riding and travel to new places on my motor bike.
